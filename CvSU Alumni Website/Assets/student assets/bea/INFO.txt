	Hi, I'm Bea Villanueva, a working student currently pursuing a BSIT. I already completed my studies in 2016, but it was only a two-year course. I continued my studies to pursue a diploma or associate degree in IT. I am actively employed while studying, showcasing my dedication and ability to manage both work and academic commitments.

	This dual commitment not only demonstrates my strong work ethic but also underscores my ability to efficiently manage both professional responsibilities and academic pursuits. I believe that this combination of hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge will provide a well-rounded foundation for my future endeavors in the dynamic field of Information Technology.

	I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to furthering my education and career in IT. My journey as a working student reflects my determination to excel in both the academic and professional realms, contributing to my personal and career growth.
